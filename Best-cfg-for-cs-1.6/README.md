# Best-cfg-for-cs-1.6
Ragedon cfg for cs 1.6 //rate + binds + adminCommends//
Config is really easy to use:

1) Extract all the config files in the game's folder (for example in my case: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Half-Life\cstrike).

2) Replace the files under the same name. And this config is in the game, enjoy.

3)For the admin menu press the "H" key on the keyboard
And you have all the admin commands for the server (only if you have admin access to a certain server).
All the binds for buying weapons can be found in the file: userconfig.cfg
Research and understand the sequence of keys that will shorten your shopping time

4)To get a nice and comfortable view, write the following command in the console without the hyphens   "exec SizeCrosshair.cfg".

Hope I helped someone with my build
